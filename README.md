# TRS-80 Model 1 - Power Supply

This project is a reimplementation of the TRS-80 Model 1 Power Supply that replicates the DC and AC voltages needed to run the original system. This revision is based on [previous work](https://github.com/maboytim/TRS-80_Model1_Power_Supply) by Matt Boytim, with slight modifications to that design. The entire project is available under the MIT license, while the reference project has been released into the Public Domain.

This version supports both 120V and 230V.

**NOTE**: A previous power supply was released by RetroStack. This new version replaces that power supply as it is cheaper to produce, lighter, and smaller.

**WARNING**: This project works with high voltages. Please proceed only if you are experienced with handling high-voltage electronics. Working on high voltages can be fatal and, if done incorrectly, could cause a fire or damage to property.

### Assembly

**Prepare Case**

1.  3D print the case (lid and base) or order it from a manufacturer.
2.  a. If 3D printed with PLA or similar material, use a soldering iron to set the knurled nuts. You can purchase a set of tools to simplify this, but a soldering iron is sufficient.

    b. If 3D printed with resin, drill out a bit more space at all six locations and set the knurled nuts with super glue. Be careful not to cover the threads, as this will cause problems when screwing things in later. Wait until the glue is fully set before moving on.

4. Paint the lettering on the top. I achieved good results using a foam brush or Q-tip. Optionally, apply a clear coat to protect the paint from wearing off.

**Electronics**

1. Solder in the transformer. Match the numbers written on the terminals to the numbers on the PCB. If you're using the ST-6-16, terminals 2 and 3 will be missing, which is fine. These are only used for the DST-6-16.
2. Solder in the two capacitors. They are polarized, so ensure the negatively marked sides match the PCB silkscreen.
3. Solder in the rectifier, aligning the direction with the PCB silkscreen.
4. Solder a 5-wire cable to the secondary side of the transformer, between the capacitors. Ideally, match a red wire to the center (~20V DC), a green/yellow wire to the outer AC connections, and a black/white wire to the two positions adjacent to the center (for ground). Matching colors or jotting down the wire colors will help you later when soldering the DIN-5 connector. You can also use a 4-wire cable, but in that case, choose only one ground pad instead of both.
5. _(Optional)_ Add a cable tie around the cable for extra strain relief.

6. Crimp two short wires to create jumpers: one between the terminal and the switch, and another from the fuse to the switch. Connect the first wire (from the connector, not the fuse) to the switch's common terminal, which is usually marked with a different color. One side of the switch will be for the light (you can typically see the lightbulb leads). Use the opposite side so the light turns on only when the switch is activated. If it's incorrect, you can swap them later. I used AWG 20 wire for this.
7. Crimp two more wires on one side, each connecting to the other side of the switch and carrying the 110V/220V AC. I used AWG 20 wire. Depending on your power unit (see below), different connections may be required.

**NOTE:** There are different configurations for the power unit. Hereâ€™s another setup I've used in the past:

8. Solder the last two wires into place on one side of the PCB (the primary side). Leave them disconnected from the power unit for now.
9. Screw in the transformer and PCB using long M4 screws and nuts.
10. Screw in the power unit. First, pull out the two crimped cables and connect them to the remaining terminals on the power unit before screwing it in.
11. Assemble the case using the smaller M3 screws.
12. Add the plastic grommet for strain relief.

13. Solder the DIN-5 connector according to this diagram:

14. Insert the fuse into the fuse holder.
